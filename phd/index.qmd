title: "About my PhD"

I'm developing and maintaining this package to go along with my PhD studies for reproducibility and to held me keep my sanity intact for the next years.

The main gist of my PhD research will be adding to the `Max-and-Smooth` method previously developed and published by my advisor, Birgir Hrafnkelsson, and others [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11969){target="_blank"}
